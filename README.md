# Assignment---Game
Christmas Assignment
This assignment will test all i've learned this semester in OOP. I will attempt to implement encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and classes. I will design a game and use beautiful images and animation. The game i've chosen to replicate is the classic Pong. It is one of the most famous games in the world. Although it's simple in its design i will try and jazz it up a bit by adding levels and obsticles. At the same time i will brighten it up using animation and visualisation.

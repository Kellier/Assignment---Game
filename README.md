# Assignment---Game
Christmas Assignment
This assignment will test all i've learned this semester in OOP. I will attempt to implement encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and classes. I will design a game and use beautiful images and animation. The game i've chosen to replicate is the classic Pong. It is one of the most famous games in the world. Although it's simple in its design i will try and jazz it up a bit by adding levels and obsticles. At the same time i will brighten it up using animation and visualisation.

During my work on the assignment i came across difficulties in implmentation of various controls and animation but managed to solve them. One such issue was the contact with the two paddles. I attempted to use a custom control where i could use joysticks but was not successful. As a solution i decided to use one paddle against the computer and found mouseY to be more useful. 

I created different difficulties and different screens to brighten up my project. In doing this it helped my understanding of inheritance and polymorphism. I was successfully able to use abstract classes and encapsulation to better the running of my game.

The menu appears as so:
